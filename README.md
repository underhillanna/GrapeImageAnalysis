# GrapeImageAnalysis
Programs for analyzing grape cluster components (and their accompanying instructions).

## Getting started
0. Read this read me!  It contains valuable information (and I spent valuable time writing it up for you, after all).
1. Ensure you have the correct [software and packages installed](https://github.umn.edu/under188/GrapeImageAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#software-and-package-needs).
2. [Prepare](https://github.umn.edu/under188/GrapeImageAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#image-preparation) and [segment](https://github.umn.edu/under188/GrapeImageAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#image-segmentation) your images.
3. Use [ImageProcess](https://github.umn.edu/under188/GrapeImageAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#using-imageprocess) to extract data from your segmented images.
4. Use [DataProcessing](https://github.umn.edu/under188/GrapeImageAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#using-dataprocessing) to clean and combine output data.

## Software and package needs
To use this set of programs, you'll need:
   * [Food Color Inspector](http://www.cofilab.com/portfolio/food-color-inspector/)
   * [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
   * [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and, for convenience, an R IDE like [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
   * A CSV editor - not necessary, but strongly recommended - for inspection of data

## Who are these programs for?
These programs are intended for those undertaking image analysis as part of their whole grape cluster phenotyping pipelines.  

## Why are these programs here?
This work was done as part of my M.S. degree at the University of Minnesota in the Grape Breeding & Enology program.
